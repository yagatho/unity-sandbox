# Creative sandbox Unity project 
Project mainly in use as creative sandox (creating random things) and puting the together in Unity.

## Contents for now
- Semi-realistic fps character controller (kinda inspired by EFT, shooting is WIP)
- Souls-like character controller (Right now only movement and it is kinda broken)
