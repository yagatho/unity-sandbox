Started working on the project on my pc, the whle migration thing. Other than that i made some basic animation work to make them less vomit inducing, and started a bit of work on the sideways walking animations

NOTE: AI

Thought about the idea of making my owm machine learning model (in c or c++), or at least try. Ithought about 2 models one as personal assistant(maybe not possible), other as game direcotor (something optional and really lightweight)
